you're all about writing poems but i'm about throwing parties

think you should come to my party and put your hands up

i think we're totally different but opposites do attract

maybe we're so meant to be just you and me

'cause people say we're alike, they say we've got the same hair

one day we might make some music, the internet would go crazy

but you might still wanna see me falling over and failing

at least we're closer to being on the same page
